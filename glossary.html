          <td>his is when you can list the items one by one, even if the list never ends. For example, 
            the set of all whole numbers (1, 2, 3, ...) is infinitely large, 
            but we can count each number one after the other. So, we call it countably infinite.</td>

          <td></td>Uncountable Infinity
          <td>This is when there are so many items that you can’t list them one by one. For example, 
            the set of all real numbers (all the decimals between 0 and 1) is infinitely large in a way that 
            you can't count them individually because there’s always another number between any two you pick. 
            This makes it uncountably infinite.</td>
